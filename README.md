  In the 2010s, counter-culture groups, those who distinguish themselves from dominant discourse, continued to thrive on the Chinese Internet. Counter-culture groups ,as one type of cultural group, is defined as “a set of publicly shared codes or repertoires, building blocks that structure people's ability to think and to share ideas” (Eliasoph and Lichterman), in other words, a group of shared norms. In sociology studies, any counter-cultural group would have “group boundaries” as the group’s relationships, imagined and real, to other counter-cultural groups (Eliasoph and Lichterman). There also exists a hierarchy among them where a cultural group might be a subset of a bigger group. While the dominant discourse in China is largely controlled by CCP propaganda, counter-culture groups can ensure more freedom of wills and speech for group members, thus being a critical angle to reveal the true opinions of Chinese people.

  The video website Bilibili, now known as the YouTube of China, has long been serving as the land of intersection of those counter-culture groups since its establishment. Different cultural groups would upload their fandom videos which contain information about the corresponding counter-culture groups. We want to explore the establishment, development of counter-cultural groups in China and how they interact with other groups from the data. Specifically, our research questions will be:
